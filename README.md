# HTML and CSS exercises for [Workshop](https://workshop.bloc.io/).

## Summary

Learn how to create a basic HTML and CSS website by organizing and styling images and text.

## Description

HTML and CSS are the two primary languages you need to know to build a web site. Although there are more advanced ways of building a site, all web developers must understand HTML and CSS, regardless of the other technologies they use.

The course starts by exploring HTML tags and how to organize different types of information on HTML pages. HTML, or Hypertext Markup Language, describes a hierarchy of visual elements that a browser can display. You'll learn about the most common elements, like headers, paragraphs, tables, and lists.

As you pick up HTML, the course will teach you CSS, or Cascading Style Sheets. While HTML describes the meaning and hierarchy of our content, it doesn't describe the *presentation* of HTML content. CSS allows you to combine vitality and glamour to make your web site beautiful and engaging.

By the end of this course, you'll be able to combine HTML and CSS to make a web site.

- Format text content and links with HTML.
- Change how content is displayed with CSS.
