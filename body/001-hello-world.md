HTML is a common way to describe the meaning and hierarchy of text so it can be formatted and displayed.

HTML usually looks like some human-readable text surrounded by "tags". Tags are denoted by angle brackets, like so:

```html
<example-tag>
  There was music in the cafes at night, and revolution in the air.
</example-tag>
```

The closing tag inserts `/` after the left angle bracket.

The most common tag is `<p>`, which is shorthand for *paragraph*.

## Assignment

Surround the text `Hello World` with the opening and closing paragraph tags.
