Welcome to Bloc's HTML & CSS Workshop course! During this course, you will learn the syntax that supports every website on the planet. Without HTML and CSS, the internet would be a different, and probably crappier place!

### Objectives

After this exercise, you can:

- Define HTML
- Recognize an HTML tag
- Identify the HTML paragraph tag

### Example

HTML, or Hypertext Markup Language, describes a hierarchy of visual elements that a browser can display.

HTML usually looks like human-readable text surrounded by **tags**. We create tags using angle brackets, like so:

```html
<example-tag>
  There was music in the cafes at night, and revolution in the air.
</example-tag>
```

Most tags require both an **opening** (`<example-tag>`) and a **closing** tag (`</example-tag>`). A forward-slash (`/`) proceeds the first angle bracket of all closing tags.

The most common tag is `<p>`, short for *paragraph*.

### Exercise

- Surround the `Hello World` text with opening and closing paragraph tags.
