Welcome to Bloc's HTML & CSS Workshop course! During this course, you will learn the syntax that supports every website on the planet. Without HTML and CSS, the internet would be a different, and probably crappier place!

### Objectives

After this exercise, you should be able to:

- Define HTML
- Recognize an HTML tag
- Identify the HTML paragraph tag

### Example

HTML, or Hypertext Markup Language, describes a hierarchy of visual elements that a browser can display.

HTML usually looks like human-readable text surrounded by **tags**. We create tags using angle brackets, like so:

```html
<example-tag>
  There was music in the cafes at night, and revolution in the air.
</example-tag>
```

Most tags require both an **opening** (`<example-tag>`) and a **closing** tag (`</example-tag>`). A forward-slash (`/`) proceeds the first angle bracket of all closing tags.

The most common tag is `<p>`, short for *paragraph*.

### Exercise

1. Create a new file in your code editor by clicking on the image shown below:

    ![create-file](https://bloc-global-assets.s3.amazonaws.com/workshop/html-css-primer/create_file.png)
2. Name the new file `index.html` and then click on the checkmark, as shown below:

    ![name-file](https://bloc-global-assets.s3.amazonaws.com/workshop/html-css-primer/name_file.png)
3. Type `Hello World`.
4. Surround `Hello World` text with opening and closing paragraph tags.
