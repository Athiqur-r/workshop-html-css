### Objectives

After this exercise, you should be able to:

- Define HTML
- Recognize an HTML tag
- Identify the HTML paragraph tag

### Example

HTML, or Hypertext Markup Language, describes a hierarchy of visual elements that a browser can display.

HTML usually looks like human-readable text surrounded by **tags**. We create tags using angle brackets, like so:

```html
<example-tag>
  There was music in the cafes at night, and revolution in the air.
</example-tag>
```

Most tags require both an **opening** (`<example-tag>`) and a **closing** tag (`</example-tag>`). A forward-slash (`/`) proceeds the first angle bracket of all closing tags.

The most common tag is `<p>`, short for *paragraph*.

### Exercise

1. Create a new file by clicking on the icon to the right of the `html-css/` directory in your code editor.
2. Name the new file `index.html` and then click on the checkmark to save the file.
3. Type `Hello World`.
4. Surround `Hello World` text with opening and closing paragraph tags.
5. Click the **Run** button.
6. If your tests pass, click the blue "Preview My Results" button to see your application.
