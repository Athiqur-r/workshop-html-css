### Objectives

After this exercise, you should be able to:

- Identify the `<html>` and `<body>` tags
- Describe which of these tags comes first
- Describe why these tags are important

### Example

The text we've added is the main content of the HTML document. This main content is called the document's *body*, and it should be surrounded by `<body>` tags.

The document's body is one part of an HTML document. (We'll get to the other part — the document's *head* — later.)  The `<body>` tags should be surrounded by `<html>` tags like this:

```html
<html>
  <body>
    <p>Some content goes here.</p>
  </body>
</html>
```

It may seem a bit verbose, but these strict formatting rules help web browsers display your document properly. Without them, browsers might display your content incorrectly, more slowly, or not at all.

### Exercise

- Correctly place `<html>` and `<body>` tags around our document.
