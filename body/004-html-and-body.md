The text we've added is the main content of the HTML document. This main content is called the document's *body*, and it should be surrounded by `<body>` tags.

The document's body is one part of an HTML document. (We'll get to the other part — the document's *head* — later.)  The `<body>` tags should be surrounded by `<html>` tags.

It may seem a bit verbose, but these strict formatting rules help web browsers display your document properly.

## Assignment

- Surround our document so far with `<body>` tags.
- Surround *those* tags with `<html>` tags.
