### Objectives

After this exercise, you can:

- Define the difference between ordered and unordered lists
- Implement the `<ol>`, `<ul>`, and `<li>` tags
- Execute a conversion from paragraph text to lists

### Example

Our page currently displays a list of information in three separate paragraphs. It makes more sense to display this information in a list.

HTML supports two types of lists: ordered lists (`<ol>`) and unordered lists (`<ul>`). Each list item is defined by a `<li>` tag.

----

Here's an ordered list:

```html
<ol>
  <li>Beyoncé</li>
  <li>Mary Virginia Cook Parrish</li>
  <li>Harriet Tubman</li>
</ol>
```

These are typically rendered with numbers, like so:

<ol>
  <li>Beyoncé</li>
  <li>Mary Virginia Cook Parrish</li>
  <li>Harriet Tubman</li>
</ol>

----

Here's an unordered list:

```html
<ul>
  <li>Archduke Charles, Duke of Teschen</li>
  <li>Edward Lear</li>
  <li>Harriet Tubman</li>
</ul>
```

These are typically rendered with bullet points, like so:

<ul>
  <li>Archduke Charles, Duke of Teschen</li>
  <li>Edward Lear</li>
  <li>Harriet Tubman</li>
</ul>

### Exercise

- Convert the four paragraphs into one unordered list with four list items.
