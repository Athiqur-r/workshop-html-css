### Objectives

After this exercise, you should be able to:

- Identify the HTML header tag (`<h1>`, `<h2>`, etc.)
- Use an HTML header tag in a document
- Understand when not to use `<h1>` tags

### Example

Not all text is *paragraph* text. Documents often have headings; headings are powerful!

When writing headings, instead of using `<p>` (and `</p>`), you use `<h1>`, `<h2>`, and up to `<h6>`.

- `<h1>`: most important text (largest).
- `<h2>`, `<h3>`,â€¦
- `<h6>`: least important text (smallest).

Your pages should have at most a single `<h1>` tag, but use other tags as many times as you like. For example, on a newspaper, "The New York Times" is in large letters on the front page. This is analogous to the `<h1>` tag.

It's not a hard and fast rule, but it keeps the importance of each heading readily distinguishable.

### Exercise

1. Open `index.html`
2. Add an `<h1>` tag at the top of your document, it should read, "Hello World Translations".
