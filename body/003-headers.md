### Objectives

After this exercise, you should be able to:

- Identify the HTML header tag
- Use an HTML header tag in a document
- Understand when not to use `<h1>` tags

### Example

Not all text is *paragraph* text. Documents often have headings. Headings are awesome!

When writing headings, instead of using `<p>` (and `</p>`), you can use `<h1>` through `<h6>`.

- `<h1>`: most important.
- `<h6>`: least important.

`<h1>`s should also only exist once on a page, while other tags can be used multiple times. For example, on a newspaper, "The New York Times" is in large letters on the front page. This is analogous to the `<h1>`.

### Exercise

- Add an `<h1>` tag at the top of your document with the title `Hello World Translations`.
