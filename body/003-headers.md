Not all text is *paragraph* text. Documents often have headings. Headings are awesome!

When writing headings, instead of using `<p>`, you can use `<h1>` through `<h6>`.

- `<h1>`: most important.
- `<h6>`: least important.

## Assignment

- Add an `<h1>` tag at the top of your document with the title `Hello World Translations`.
